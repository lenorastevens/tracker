# Overview

I am actively working on learning new programming languages and practicing leaning how to apply each language to a programming project.

I was able to work through tutorials that helped me understand using data types to set up a list program.  My typescript creates a list item, add that to a list class and renders the list class to a main display area.  The user is able to add as many items to the list that they want, they are also able to check off a finished item, delete and item, or clear the whole list.  At the top of the program is an inspiration quote that will change out automatically every 5 minutes or every time the page is reset. 

My purpose for writing this software was to give myself the added experience with typescript with my HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I have previously been exposed to.  My research has shown me that typescript is a valuable skill to have in the Web Development industry.

# Future Work

- This program has a lot of room for expansion.  It would be nice to have the ablitiy to make more than one list or store lists for later, etc.
- This list tracker is quite plain.  It would be better to have icons, and images to make it more interesting.
- Quote api source is quite limited.  A better API source would be good to find.
